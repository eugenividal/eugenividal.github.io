  <h2>Background and rationale</h2>  
  <p>In the late 1990s and early 2000s, interest in transport disadvantage and its influence on the social exclusion of low-income people grew substantially (Lucas, 2012). The field of ‘transport equity’, which aims to “include social and spatial factors in social welfare assessment” emerged (Di Ciommo and Shiftan, 2017 p. 140), coinciding with increasing policy attention in this area. Examples include schemes implemented by: the Social Exclusion Unit (SEU) in the UK (Unit, 2003); the Victoria Department of Transport (VICDOT) in Australia (Lucas, 2012); and the Société de transport de Montréal (STM) in Canada (Manaugh and El-Geneidy, 2012).</p>
  <p>A notable feature of research into and policies addressing transport equity to date is their tendency to focus on public transport and, to a lesser extent, walking. Far less attention has been paid to cycling, despite evidence of the role that this affordable and widely available mode could play in efforts to reduce transport-related social inequalities (Iacono et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2017).</p>
  <p>Cycling can increase social inclusion and improve health among socioeconomically disadvantaged populations in a number of ways. Cycling is generally less expensive yet just as fast as motorised modes of transport (Olde Kalter, 2007). Buying, storing and maintaining bicycles requires some time, money and space resources, and cycling is not appropriate for all (generally short, intra-city) trips, however, it is a cheaper and faster potential option for the majority of trips in most cities. In the UK’s National Travel Survey, for example, 53.6% of all 4,432,170 trip stages in the 2002 to 2016 data set were below 5 km in distance (source: own analysis of NTS), a proportion that grows in deprived urban areas.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, the physical activity involved in cycling is conducive to health and well-being. Research has shown that low-income populations have a poorer health condition and lower life expectancy than wealthier populations (National Academies of Sciences, and Medicine, Engineering, 2017; Public Health England, 2017). This is partly due to lower levels of physical activity among low-income groups (Farrell et al., 2013), suggesting that the health benefits of cycling could be particularly great for socioeconomically disadvantaged populations.</p>

  <h2>Aim and research questions</h2>   
  <p>The aim of the PhD is to contribute to the knowledge of the factors that affect the use of the bicycle among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups in England. The results will provide an evidence base that could feed into future policies that are effective at enable these groups to cycle more. This would have multiple benefits. Cycling can facilitate participation a wider range of activities and opportunities, as well as overcome health inequalities. In addition, the inclusion of more bicycle users as a means of transport will contribute to reducing motorised transport, which will help to tackle other issues of fundamental importance for society, such as climate change, complex mobility problems and environmental pollution.</p>
  <p>This aim leads to the following Central Research Question (CRQ):</p>
  <p><i>To what extent do socioeconomically disadvantaged groups in England have fewer opportunities to benefit from cycling than non-disadvantaged groups?</i></p>
  <p>This question can be divided into four research sub-questions:</p>  
  <p><i>1.	What does the scientific literature state with regard to cycling equity among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups?</i></p>
  <p><i>2.	What effect do socioeconomic variables have on utility (transport) and recreational cycling participation in England?</i></p>
  <p><i>3.	To what extent are deprived areas of England bikeable compared to non-deprived areas?</i></p>
  <p><i>4.	To what degree have socioeconomically disadvantaged groups in England a greater risk of being injured or killed while riding a bicycle than non-disadvantaged groups?</i></p>
